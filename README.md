# HRSpace User Stories Update

#### HRSpace is a human resources platform that supports HR in the employees' database management and paperwork process with an ease.

### User Story

HRSpace's target users are Human Resources employees who have to deal with a huge amount of paperwork and employee's information accumulation. With just a name, an email, a password, and a company name, each user can register an account as the admin for that company. Email and company are unique among the users of the platforms.

There are 3 user roles in the platform: Admin, Manager, and Employee. While the ADMIN can access all pages, the other roles can access the allowed information.

| No.            | Manager                                               | Employee                          |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Employees List | Can see employees' list under manager's management    | Can not                           |
| Information    | Can see employees' info under manager's management    | Can see employee's info only      |
| Review         | Can see employees' reviews under manager's management | Can see employee's review only    |
| Paperwork      | Can not view employees' paperwork                     | Can see employee's paperwork only |

After logging in HRSpace, based on their roles, users can see a list of employees that created in the database and paginate among the list. Besides, users can search employees by name or filter by status, department, employment type.

If there's no employee yet, admins can create new employee by providing the requested information like name, onboarding date, department, etc.

By accessing employee detailed page, admin users can view or edit employees information. Paperwork section is the place for users to check paperwork status and generate a new paperwork in accordance with provided employee's data.

When any paperwork created successfully, a related review for that paperwork will be automatically generated. This Review section is all for paperwork renew consideration. Admins can share the review by themeselves to remind the manager on review conduction.
